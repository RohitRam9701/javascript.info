## __Structure__

Every chapter, article or a task has its folder.

The folder is named like __`N-url`__, where __`N`__ is a number for the sorting purposes and __`url`__ is the URL part with title of the material.

The type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:

  - __`index.md`__ stands for a chapter
  - __`article.md`__ stands for an article
  - __`task.md`__ stands for a task (solution must be provided in __`solution.md`__ file aswell)

Each of these files starts from the `# Main header`.

Assets required for the material reside in the same folder.
