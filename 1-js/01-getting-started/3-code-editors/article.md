# Code editors

A code editor is where programmers spend most of their time.

The two main types are IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

"[IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)" are powerful editors with many features that usually operates on a whole project. As the name suggests, it's not just an editor, but a full-scale "development environment." An IDE loads the full project (which can be many files) and has features such as:

- Navigate between files and folders
- Autocomplete text based on the whole project (not just the open file)
- Integrate with a version management system (like [git](https://git-scm.com/))
- Integrate with a testing environment
- Other "project-level" stuff

Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer's salary, so just choose the best one for you. If you haven't selected an IDE yet, consider these options:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (cross-platform, paid).

For Windows-only, there's also "Visual Studio", not to be confused with "Visual Studio Code". "Visual Studio" is a paid and mighty editor well-suited for the .NET platform. It's also good for JavaScript. The free version is [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

## Lightweight editors

"Lightweight editors" are less powerful than IDEs, but they're fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.

The main difference between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that an IDE works on a project-level. It loads much more data on start,  and analyzes the project structure if needed. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.

In practice, lightweight editors may have many plugins. For example, directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there's no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.

There are many options, for instance:

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.

## Let's not argue

The editors above are recommended by me or friends who I consider good developers. We've used them for a long time and we're happy with them.

There are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.

The choice of a tool is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.

The author's personal opinion:

- I'd use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if I develop mostly frontend.
- Otherwise, if it's mostly another language/platform and partially frontend, then consider other editors, such as XCode (Mac), Visual Studio (Windows) or Jetbrains family (Webstorm, PHPStorm, RubyMine etc, depending on the language).
